# Vladislav Kozeletskiy #fisherenok

Hi, I'm Vladislav — a middle javascript developer working on various project, especially in startups. I live in Belarus, city Minsk and am an Slonim native. 🙌 I'm a huge JavaScript geek, volleyball player, and lead a healthy lifestyle. 💕

💖 Safety and trust<br>
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared norms<br>

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
